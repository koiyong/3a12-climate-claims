 ## Analysis of Climate Claims: Everything Climate on the Issue of Antarctic Sea Ice
  ##### Natalie Kwong (Oct 24, 2021)

  ### Evaluating the claim: is there significant loss of Antarctic sea ice?
  The article makes two main points: first, that the melting of Antarctic ice is not unusual, and that there is no increase correlated with the increase in CO2 emissions over time. Instead, the author of this article attributes it to natural melting that occurs in interglacial periods. Secondly, they argue that even though Antarctic ice shows some melting, it is nowhere near significant enough to warrant concern. They compare the mass lost to the total ice mass and say that it  is not significant compared to the total amount of Antarctic ice present. 

This website is associated with Anthony Watts (of ‘Watt’s Up With That?’), although this connection is not obvious from the website. He is a well-known climate skeptic and often speaks on behalf of anti-climate change groups (Liu, 2017). This means he is likely to push a viewpoint denying climate change. Not all the linked articles are in the reference list and the reference format makes it difficult to tell what information corresponds to which claim in the article. Some of the sources that are linked but do not appear in the reference list are from other climate skeptic blogs. Because of this, the article loses credibility. 

In terms of the arguments themselves, they initially seem to be well constructed. The article mostly focuses on refuting the idea of problematic Antarctic sea ice melting using statistics and findings from scientific articles. However, there is one main logical issue: although the numbers themselves come from scientific sources, the bulk of the article rests on the claim that these numbers are not significant. This part of the argument comes purely from the author themselves, with no outside sources to support it. This, along with other issues in the article explored below, make the main arguments found here uncredible. 

The author often aims to refute a specific part of a claim, but then implies that this disproves the entire argument. For example, they state that 6.4 trillion tons of ice only makes up 0.0003% of total Antarctic ice mass. Even if this is true, the fact that the number looks small does not preclude it from being significant. Furthermore, the article fails to mention that these findings match with IPCC worst-case models for climate change, which would support the idea that this sea level rise is something to worry about (IPCC, 2014). 

There are also several false claims made in the article. At one point the author claims that there are no long-term historical data on ice mass. This is incorrect; multiple studies using ice cores and isotopes have calculated historic CO2 and Antarctic ice mass (Lisieki and Raymo, 2005, Jouzel et al., 2007). The first assertion that we are simply in an interglacial period also fails to mention that although warming is natural, the rate at which warming is happening is much faster than expected for an interglacial period, and is also correlated with increased CO2 production (Lüthi et al., 2008).  

Statements from outside sources are also presented out of context and in bad faith. The quote from Nature (Singh and Polvani, 2020) is out of context. The full paper reveals that the authors assert the reality and severity of global warming. Their models incorporate CO2-forced warming, indicating that the high elevation of the Antarctic ice sheet is contributing to the relative lack of melting. Another example of this is the figure indicating global sea change levels. The author states that the graph shows consistent and unchanging increases in sea level. However, navigating to the source (US Global Change Research Program, 2019) will again show that the data represents an increasing rate of change in sea level.
